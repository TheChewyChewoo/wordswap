# wordswap
Instructions:
Download Java and this: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-windows
I'd recommend getting the installer.
After this, install the program by using the installer.
Then, open command prompt.
Direct your way to the folder you put the files in. If you're unsure how to do this, please watch a tutorial on Youtube or something.
After you've directed your way to the file, enter "javac Swap.java"
Now, the java file is compiled. To enter the text you want to swap, go to "words.txt" and input the text.
You will still need Command Prompt open to run the program.
To swap the text, enter "java Swap.java"
